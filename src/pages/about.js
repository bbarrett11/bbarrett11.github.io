      <h1>Benjamin Jackson Barrett</h1>
      <p>Hello! I'm a third year at the University of Virginia. Double majoring in Computer Science and Math. In addition to
        my majors, I love philosophy, playing music, and reading. Over the past few years I've had some great opportunities
        and interned at some great companies doing software development work. I primarily have done back-end work, but I do have some full stack experience as well.
